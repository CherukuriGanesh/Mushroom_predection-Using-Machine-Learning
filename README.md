## Introduction
Mushrooms have a wide variety of characteristics that can determine whether they are edible or poisonous. Misclassification can lead to severe consequences, so this project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to provide a reliable classification system based on mushroom data.

## Features
- **Input Data**: Mushroom characteristics such as cap shape, odor, gill color, etc.
- **Output**: Edible or Poisonous classification.
- **Algorithms Used**:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mushroom-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd mushroom-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook mushroom_prediction.ipynb
   ```
   or
